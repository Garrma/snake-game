# Snake game

Final grading project Msc 203 python course.

Quick implementation of a project known by everyone : snake. <br>

The user interface could have been elaborated in a more graphical way but the true complexity was in the game itself. Due to the flexibility of the code structure, it was easy to add a changes to the original game with more original and entertaining features. 

See initial instructions [here](Docs/instructions.pdf)

## interface

The game comes with a very basic panel, allowing the user to add obstacles to the original game and make them move to make the game more challenging.
